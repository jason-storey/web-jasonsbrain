I get asked often enough about the various bits of software I have on my machines so here is an almost exhaustive list. 
I'll try to keep it somewhat up to date as I find new cool toys. 

| Software                                          | description                                                                        |

| [[Garden/Areas/Software/PowerToys\|PowerToys]] | A general grab bag of windows improvements. I mostly use it for keyboard shortcuts |
| [[Garden/Areas/Software/Eagle\|Eagle]]         | Media and File Management Software                                                 |
