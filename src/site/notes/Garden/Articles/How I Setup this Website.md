It's using this fantastic digital garden template. 

https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden

Why this instead of obsidian publish? The main reason is that the static generated site will resolve dataview before it publishes meaning that I can keep all the fun dynamic links and tables. 
This is a bit of a deal breaker to me as I want to keep things up to date with very little micro-management. 

it might be a silly example but being able to say there are 11 notes in this website and that the number there is going to update as I plod along is very <span class="borf">satisfying</span>.

This video is a great introduction to how its all configured.

I did go a few steps further than that example and setup some custom javascript and css. I might go into more detail once I have decided what I want to do with it. Mostly I just set it up to know how to for now.
