More of a graphic body horror experience than I was expecting. It was pretty entertaining and well directed. It didn't really break any new ground and despite having a poignant topic and cast it just felt very generic shlock. That being said it was a very successful shlock. I enjoyed my time but think there was a chance for me to leave the film introspecting my relationship to the problems it points at, while instead I was just left questioning if I should have waited till after the movie to make dinner...
