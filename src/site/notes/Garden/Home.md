For all my love of talking I find writing surprisingly hard.

I get asked to often enough that It's a muscle I should exercise. Here is a general dropzone of whatever I am thinking about or working on. All opinions are my own and should be treated as the ravings of a lunatic and no coherence expressed or implied is to be trusted. 

Some spots you might want to check out:
